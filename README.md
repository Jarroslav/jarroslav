As a **Lead/Senior Test Automation QA Engineer** with over six years of experience, I specialize in leading teams and architecting robust quality assurance processes from the ground up. I'm a hands-on technical expert who thrives on solving complex challenges, but my true passion lies in empowering teams and building a culture of excellence. Quality is a shared responsibility, and I use my expertise in Lean Management to drive continuous improvement that boosts both efficiency and product quality.

My career milestones include:
- Successfully advocating for and securing the expansion of the AQA team, enabling us to stabilize a critical startup project and achieve departmental autonomy.
- Leading a complete revamp of a QA framework, transitioning it from JavaScript to TypeScript, and stabilizing over 200 failing automated tests.
- Pioneering CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Bitbucket, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions, which streamlined our testing and deployment practices.
- Building a custom Cypress parallelization solution that eliminated the need for a paid dashboard, resulting in approximately $3,000 in annual savings.
- Mentoring diverse QA teams of up to 10 members, contributing to a 35% reduction in bug reports, and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

I possess a deep technical skill set in JavaScript and TypeScript, with a mastery of automation frameworks like Cypress and Playwright. My expertise extends to cloud technologies (Azure DevOps, Kubernetes) and API testing, ensuring comprehensive coverage for modern web and desktop applications.

My proactive demeanor and in-depth understanding of QA processes have earned me a reputation as a go-to problem-solver among colleagues and clients. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what QA can achieve, ensuring every project I engage with delivers exceptional results.
